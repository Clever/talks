# Talks

These talks can be viewed online at http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/Clever/talks/home.article

## Development

To render these talks locally, install the [present command](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present) (requires Go):

```
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

Then run the present server in this directory:

```
$ $GOPATH/bin/present
```

Then you can view the talks in your web browser by going to http://127.0.0.1:3999.
